## Description

Fully functional and fullstack e-commerce website.

- Includes pages from product listing, product detail page, to user login, payment, shipment, etc.
- Admin area with CRUD functionality for users, products and orders.
- Authentication handled with JWT.
- Redux for state management.
- MongoDB

## Key takeaways

This is a complex project both in the backend and frontend.
Besides all route and controller logic with authentication, CRUD
and so on in the backend, my main takeaway for this project is the
state management with Redux in the frontend which is depicted in the diagram below.

## Structure

See below the diagrams for both frontend and backend.
<small>\* Some code/components were omitted for simplicity matter (e.g. orderController).</small>

### Frontend Diagram

<br />

#### Store

Combines all reducers and apply thunk (middleware that allows
you to return functions).

<details>

  <summary>
    <ins>View code</ins>
    <span>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
    </span>
  </summary>

```js
const reducer = combineReducers({
  productList: productListReducer,
  //followed by all other reducers...
});

const cartItemsFromStorage = localStorage.getItem('cartItems')
  ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cartItems'))
  : [];

//followed by other localStorage variables...

const initialState = {
  cart: {
    cartItems: cartItemsFromStorage,
    shippingAddress: shippingAddressFromStorage,
  },
  userLogin: { userInfo: userInfoFromStorage },
};

const middleware = [thunk];

const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  initialState,
  composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(...middleware))
);

export default store;
```

</details>
<br />

#### Thunk

Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to return functions, rather than just actions, within Redux. This allows for delayed actions, including working with promises. One of the main use cases for this middleware is handling asynchronous actions like using axios to send a GET request as seen in the Actions API call.

#### Constants

Just holds the constants names. The cases are: REQUEST, SUCCESS, FAIL, RESET.

#### Actions

Using async try/catch it fetches APIs and dispatches a type (e.g. REQUEST, SUCCESS, FAIL, RESET) that hits a Switch Case in the Reducer.

<details>

  <summary>
    <ins>View code</ins>
    <span>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
    </span>
  </summary>

```jsx
export const listProducts =
  (keyword = '', pageNumber = '') =>
  async (dispatch) => {
    try {
      dispatch({
        type: PRODUCT_LIST_REQUEST,
      });

      const { data } = await axios.get(
        `/api/products?keyword=${keyword}&pageNumber=${pageNumber}`
      );

      dispatch({
        type: PRODUCT_LIST_SUCCESS,
        payload: data,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      dispatch({
        type: PRODUCT_LIST_FAIL,
        payload:
          error.response && error.response.data.message
            ? error.response.data.message
            : error.message,
      });
    }
  };
```

</details>
<br />

#### Reducers

Takes previous state and action with its Switch Case and returns next state.

<details>

  <summary>
    <ins>View code</ins>
    <span>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
    </span>
  </summary>

```jsx
export const productListReducer = (state = { products: [] }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case PRODUCT_LIST_REQUEST:
      return { loading: true, products: [] };
    case PRODUCT_LIST_SUCCESS:
      return {
        loading: false,
        products: action.payload.products,
        pages: action.payload.pages,
        page: action.payload.page,
      };
    case PRODUCT_LIST_FAIL:
      return { loading: false, error: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

</details>
<br />

#### Screens

useDispatch & useSelector are both Redux Hooks.<br />
useDispatch will trigger the action and useSelector will receive the state.

#### Components

Some components also use Redux, like ProductCarousel and Header.

### Backend Diagram

<iframe style="border:none" width="100%" height="550" src="https://whimsical.com/embed/aqVxiWzGmMuuHVkkEmWH4"></iframe>
<br />

#### Server

The heart of the backend application. Connects to the DB via
config/db and uses all routes made available by routes (order,
product, user, upload) and error handling directly from the
middleware.

#### Config/db

Makes the connection to the database.

#### Routes

Best regarded as Endpoints. Route methods (get, post, put,
delete) are defined for the specified route and used in
conjunction with a controller and middleware functions, which
hold the logic. (e.g. router.post(&apos;/login&apos;,
authUser))

#### Controllers

Best regarded as the application logic. The functions defined
here will be requested when hitting the defined
routes/endpoints. It is the place where the logic for a given
route is applied.

#### Middleware

Either called directly from server.js for errorHandling or
from a given route, in this case userRoute, for both protect
and isAdmin functions. protect will make sure that the user is
logged in by verifying their bearer token (which is generated
by the util). isAdmin will make sure that the given user has
admin rights.

#### Utils

Generates a token which is called from the userController.
(e.g. when logging in a user)

#### Models

Defines the DB schema for a given model. userModal.js also
uses bcrypt to compare and hash passwords.
