            <p>
              My developer career started with a great emphasis on e-commerce as
              a Shopware Front End Developer and I even worked on the
              development of <i className='fas fa-link'></i>{' '}
              <a
                href='https://github.com/shopware/platform'
                target='_blank'
                rel='noreferrer'>
                Shopware 6
              </a>
              . Later on I specialized in React and it&apos;s ecosystem. I
              really like problem-solving in general and am addicted to the
              feeling of solving them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides Web Development I have a diverse work experience ranging
              from Airfreight Logistics at the Frankfurt Airport in Germany to
              Customer Support in Tech Companies around Europe and Brazil.
            </p>

            <p>
              I&apos;m no stranger to multiculturalism and I appreciate
              diversity as well as discovering and experiencing new cultures.
              Loving nature and being outdoors makes my favorite pastime hiking
              and mountain climbing.
